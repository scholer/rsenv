"""

This module is meant to integrate and unify all data conversion methods.

That is, you have the data in one format, e.g. xarray dataset,
and you would like to convert that data to another data format,
e.g. Pandas DataFrame.

Note: This does explicitly not deal with reading data from disk.

Anything that can be read directly from a file to the correct data format is in the 'io' package.
