Regarding changeset 157:801ad3c10f3fm, got errors in the robot:

Loading error
Code: 0x 1902

Could not open method!
ErrorCode 0x00001902



File check:

Name under version is wrong (includes output folder and .dws.dws twice

Still get error

Deleting all SampleTransfer cmds
saving as _3


Still get error

Uh, all placeit cmds has same header/cmdindex
and comment and numsamples headers are not properly formatted.

Error is now gone, but I get a new warning instead:

"The position of the following labware is not allowed anymore tips004
in location: B0
code 0x 1910.

I get this code multiple times.
B0 is the parking position, so not sure why I would use that.

This is 
EnumMatType=4

EnumSlotNr=155

Use EnumSlotNr=152 instead.

So, changes:
1) change valet
   -- slots checked valet updated. 155 and 153 was reversed.
2) change header for placeit
   - ok, added cmdnum += 1
3) change header for after-placeit 
   - trying to only pass cmdindex
Ok, seems to be fixed.


Uh... Another issue...
It seem the dest and src positions are completely wrong??
"posToRowColTup(E11) returned (rownum,colnum) = (5,1)"
This should be 5,
colnum = int(pos[1:len(pos)-1]) # Should not subtract 1 !!
 --> colnum = int(pos[1:len(pos)])
